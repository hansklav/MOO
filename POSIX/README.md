# MOO, MasterMind, Pico-Fermi-Bagels

As a programming exercise for a simple command-line game I made these different versions of the game of Moo.

I started with MooMmPfB.Mod which not only plays Moo, but also has options to play MasterMind and Pico-Fermi-Bagels.
Later I wanted to add a League Table and for this I made a simplified version that only plays classic UNIX MOO.

If you like to study the code it's best to start with Moo0.Mod, which has the simplest source text.
I wrote MooC.Mod after I had found the C-source (moo.c) to see what an Oberon version of that would look like.

I find Moo0.Mod more readable and understandable than the C source code, also because Oberon can make use of the SET datatype.
