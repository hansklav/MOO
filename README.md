# MOO
The game of MOO.

While glancing through the First Edition Unix Programmer's Manual (1971) I was struck by the following page in Section VI ('User-maintained programs'): 
```
NAME               moo -- a game      
SYNOPSIS           /usr/games/moo
DESCRIPTION        moo is a guessing game imported from England.

The programmer of this game, Ken Thompson, is also the author of the UNIX Operating system and wrote several games for its early editions (Blackjack, Chess, Tic-tac-toe) and they all have more extensive descriptions. So I was intrigued by this game 'moo'.
